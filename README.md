# techBit
An all-in-one resource platform for computer science students and enthusiasts to get knowledge about a wide variety of tech-related resources such as tools, courses, articles and coding competitions. 

## Technologies Used
This is a complete full-stack web application. The frontend has been made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with various javascript libraries such as Slick (for carousels). The backend has been developed using Node.js and Oracle Express edition for databases.

## Description 
The web app is dynamic; it allows users to register and choose their tech-related interests from multiple options. Users can modify their accounts by changing their profile picture and adding links to their social media accounts.
Users can view and "save"/"bookmark" the items they are highly interested in and want to easily access again in the future. The "bookmarked" items are stored in a separate section and can be accessed later. Users can alse "unsave" any items if they wish to do so.
The web app also provides a search functionality through which users can search for particular articles, courses or coding competitions by entering desired keywords.
Each rresource provides a link to its source website where users can directly check out that particular resource.

## Suggestions
This web app has been made as part of a university course project by Software Engineering students. It is open for future development and improvements. An idea is to apply machine learning algorithms to recommend to users items related to their past activity and interests.

Any suggestions for improvements, modifications and further advancements are highly welcome.
